# COMPILING.

Question one What platform?

if you chose windows! it already contains the tools needed!
just run build.py and get ready!

If you are on linux However. YOU ARE IN LUCK!!! With the latest Patch. Simply Run the following commands!

pip3 install pyinstaller

pyinstaller --onefile main.py

Your Compiled file will be in dist!

for UNIX im pretty sure its the same as linux? Idk man. Never got a UNIX Device into my hand.

# INSTALLING

Simply Download The Binary for your system. On Windows its a .exe. on linux its mostly just gamelab (Run it like: ./gamelab)

No need to worry about the json stuff now. It generates them automatically!

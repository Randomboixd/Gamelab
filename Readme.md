# Warning. This project is OLD!

Im not providing any updates for this. However i thought i'd release this to the public.

So there... I might make a smaller version of this with... actually not spaghetti code.

So there is the original Readme.md

Also if you're trying this... I removed the Discord Devportal thingy as i deleted it a long time ago. So don't enable Rich Presence!


# Gamelab. A little Collection of games i wrote for the sake of fun.

- Features:
- 3 games! (and more in the future)
- Discord Rich Presence (Kinda Working but still buggy.)
- Compiled .exes and binaries! (For windows and linux!)
- All based on basic python and json.
